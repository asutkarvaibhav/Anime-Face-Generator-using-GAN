# GAN-Project
**This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate anime-style faces. The model is trained on a dataset of anime character images and produces new, realistic-looking anime faces.**

**Features**

Generates high-quality anime faces  Implemented using PyTorch

One notebook covers both training and generation

**Tech Stack**

Python

PyTorch

torchvision

matplotlib

**Dataset**
You can use datasets like: https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset

**Notes**

For best results, use a GPU (e.g., Google Colab or local CUDA).

Training time and quality may vary depending on the number of epochs and dataset size.
