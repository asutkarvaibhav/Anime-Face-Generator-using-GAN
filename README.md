# GAN-Project
**This project focuses on generating anime-style faces using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) built with PyTorch. The model learns from a dataset of anime character images and gradually improves its ability to create visually appealing, realistic anime faces. The training and image generation process is fully handled within a single Jupyter notebook.**

**Features**  
Generates high-quality anime faces  
Implemented using PyTorch  
One notebook covers both training and generation

**Tech Stack**  
Python  
PyTorch  
torchvision  
matplotlib

**Dataset**  
You can use datasets like: https://www.kaggle.com/splcher/animefacedataset

**Notes**  
For best results, use a GPU (e.g., Google Colab or local CUDA).  
Training time and quality may vary depending on the number of epochs and dataset size.
